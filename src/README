1. Automatic Player Strategies:

• WhateverPlayer:
  Selects a move uniformly at random from all currently empty squares on the board.
  This player does not analyze board state or attempt to create / block winning sequences.

• NaivePlayer:
  Scans the board from top-left to bottom-right.
  The first square found that is empty is selected, and the player's mark is placed there.
  This is a deterministic “first available square” strategy.

• SmartPlayer:
  First checks for horizontal threats made by the opponent:
  For each row, if the opponent has (winStreak - 1) marks in a row and there is one remaining blank
  needed to complete the streak, the SmartPlayer places its mark in that blank to block the threat.
  If no such threat exists, the player selects the *last* available empty square on the board
  by scanning from bottom-right to top-left.
  This strategy reliably outperforms both WhateverPlayer and NaivePlayer, achieving the required
  win rate in large tournaments.

2. Use of the Player Interface (OOP Design):

All player classes implement the same Player interface.
This allows the Game and Tournament classes to interact with players without knowing their internal
implementation details.
.
The design is based on the **polymorphism** pillar of object-oriented programming.
By treating each player as a "Player" rather than a specific class, the code is cleaner, extendable,
and supports adding new strategies in the future without modifying the game flow.

3. Additional Classes Added:

No additional classes were added beyond those required in the assignment specification.
